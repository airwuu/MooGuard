currently cow has nothing

- the cow component is something put at the bottom of the dashboard

- this component takes the current selected cow
  - by default the first cow of the list. the selected cow changes depending on: 
    - the dot the user clicks on the grid
    - the name the user clicks on the data table

  - if there's no cow 
    - "Moo! You have no cows!"
  - if there is a cow:
    - cow name 
    - slider and grid (copy slider and grid from Grid)
    - illness percentage
    - eating times (chart)
    - whatever else fancy statistics
